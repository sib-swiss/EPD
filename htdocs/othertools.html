experimentally validated promoters were stored in the
EPDnew database, which can be downloaded from our ftp
site. Scientists are welcome to use our other tools
<a href='https://epd.expasy.org/chipseq/'>ChIP-Seq</a>
(for correlation analysis) and
<a href='https://epd.expasy.org/ssa/'>SSA</a>
(for motif analysis around promoters) to analyze the
EPDnew database.
