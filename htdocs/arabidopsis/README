This file contains an action plan for A. thaliana EPDnew release with
informations on variables that are usefull in this context:

Assembly used: at10

Reference Gene List: TAIR10 (protein coding genes annotated in gff
                     format)

Genome annotation files: EPDnew and TAIR10 promoters

UCSC browser link: there is an hub in UCSC GB (Plants) that support
                   at10 (araTha1). It has a RepeatMasker track.

Other browsers: there is the TAIR GBrowser. Given the fact that in the
                field anyone uses TAIR, this might be the browser of
                choice. It is not UCSC-based but it accept all normal
                formats for custom tracks (bed, bw, ...) but I am not
                sure how it works for the upload (can I make it in the
                link or do I have to go trough a submit button?). Need
                to check!
